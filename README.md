## Features
 - Mesh Architecture
 -- There is no central server, every device makes a piece of the network.
 -- Peers can discover others globally, using the SHINE technology.
 - Anonymity
 -- Nodes within UnderNet use 512bit network ids instead of IP addresses for identification. Your IP address will only be known to the neighboring nodes.
 - Resource distribution
 -- After being published, resources such as files, will be distributed to appropriate nodes within the network and can be retrieved back using their network ids.
 - Direct Communication
 -- A direct or multicast connection between nodes can be established using tunnels. (Not yet implemented)
 - Multi-platform
 -- Currently the network is being developed to be fully functional on standalone as well as Android devices, but with its modular design, it should be easy to port it to other platforms.

## Want to help?
The project is in its very early stages of development and most of the features described above have not yet been implemented. If you're experienced with networking and Java and would like to help the project, feel free to fork, develop and issue pull requests. The project is set up with Gradle and can be opened and built with Intellij IDEA.

#### Expected to release before 2020
